# Warning
This game runs in 60 FPS so if you prefer to have your OS run at 30 FPS, change it back after playing the game.

# About the game
This game was a small project of mine to understand HolyC, Im using TinkerOS instead of TempleOS because it just works better and it looks more like TempleOS and HolyC is also like TempleOS unlike ZealOS

# Installation (This game only works in TinkerOS)
To install the game, download the ISO.C file, load it into your virtual machine and use Mount to mount it. (for those who are not experienced, you have to extract the files onto your hard drive to run it)
